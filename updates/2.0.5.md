# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Implemented a new webhooks system (checkout `tpz_core/server/discord/webhooks.lua`). All the Url's are going to be located on this file and **ONLY**! This will require from you to redownload **ALL** the scripts you are having and replace `fxmanifest.lua` and **ALL** server side files and only. After updating all scripts, on the configuration file search for `webhook` and **remove** everywhere that contains `Url = ""` option and **ONLY** that! Otherwise they will still see the webhooks urls, this option must be deleted from every script. All of our webhooks are now located on `webhooks.lua` file and not through the script config since all the configuration files are shared, a RedM Executer can find all of your script webhooks easily and spam or share them to others.

2. Added a json encode for new characters creation for preventing skin reload and revive errors (those errors are not displayed after a relog but only once character is new and playing without relog as first time).
